abstract={Attraction between the atoms of a Bose--Einstein condensate renders it unstable to collapse, although a condensate with a limited number of atoms1 can be stabilized2 by confinement in an atom trap. However, beyond this number the condensate collapses3,4,5. Condensates constrained to one-dimensional motion with attractive interactions are predicted to form stable solitons, in which the attractive forces exactly compensate for wave-packet dispersion1. Here we report the formation of bright solitons of 7Li atoms in a quasi-one-dimensional optical trap, by magnetically tuning the interactions in a stable Bose--Einstein condensate from repulsive to attractive. The solitons are set in motion by offsetting the optical potential, and are observed to propagate in the potential for many oscillatory cycles without spreading. We observe a soliton train, containing many solitons; repulsive interactions between neighbouring solitons are inferred from their motion.},

abstract = {After more than 30 years development, ultracold atoms have become a versatile platform with a wide range of applications, from studying very fundamental physics such as basic properties of BEC, to making practical devices such as atomic clock. Among these applications, the spinor quantum gas, a quantum gas with spin degree of freedom, has attracted a lot of attentions, both experimentally and theoretically. Whereas all previous studies focus on spinor gases of single atomic species, in this thesis we present the first experimental studies of coherent spin-mixing dynamics in a spinor mixture of ⁸⁷Rb and ²³Na.},

abstract = {This thesis presents a series of investigations on an ultracold heteronuclear mixture of ²³Na and ⁸⁷Rb. These investigations are carried out in two different apparatuses of double species Bose-Einstein condensate constructed in the course of this thesis work. Firstly, the interspecies Feshbach resonances are measured and analyzed. An s-wave Feshbach resonance is used to control the interspecies interactions and the miscible-immiscible transition of the double species Bose-Einstein condensate is observed. Secondly, the ultra-cold bosonic Feshbach molecules of NaRb are formed by magneto-association. Binding energies of the Feshbach molecules are measured and analyzed with a two-channel square well model. Thirdly, we study several few-body processes with this mixture. With the same s-wave Feshbach resonance, we measure the scattering length dependent dimer-dimer and atom-dimer loss rates and find two resonances which are closely related to the three-body Efimov effect. These results will shed new light on our understanding of several important elementary few-body processes and also establish the Na-Rb mixture as a nice system for such investigations.},

abstract = {molscat is a general-purpose program for quantum-mechanical calculations on nonreactive atom–atom, atom–molecule and molecule–molecule collisions. It constructs the coupled-channel equations of atomic and molecular scattering theory, and solves them by propagating the wavefunction or log-derivative matrix outwards from short range to the asymptotic region at long range. It then applies scattering boundary conditions to extract the scattering matrix (S matrix). Built-in coupling cases include atom + rigid linear molecule, atom + vibrating diatom, atom + rigid symmetric top, atom + asymmetric or spherical top, rigid diatom + rigid diatom, rigid diatom + asymmetric top, and diffractive scattering of an atom from a crystal surface. Interaction potentials may be specified either in program input (for simple cases) or with user-supplied routines. For the built-in coupling cases, molscat can loop over total angular momentum (partial wave) and total parity to calculate elastic and inelastic integral cross sections and spectroscopic line-shape cross sections. Post-processors are available to calculate differential cross sections, transport, relaxation and Senftleben–Beenakker cross sections, and to fit the parameters of scattering resonances. molscat also provides an interface for plug-in routines to specify coupling cases (Hamiltonians and basis sets) that are not built in; plug-in routines are supplied to handle collisions of a pair of alkali-metal atoms with hyperfine structure in an applied magnetic field. For low-energy scattering, molscat can calculate scattering lengths and effective ranges and can locate and characterise scattering resonances as a function of an external variable such as the magnetic field.
Program summary
Program Title: molscat Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/rtzgf5mwpn.1 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Fortran 90 External routines/libraries: LAPACK, BLAS Nature of problem: Quantum-mechanical calculations of scattering properties for non-reactive collisions between atoms and molecules. Solution method: The Schrödinger equation is expressed in terms of coupled equations in the interparticle distance, R. Solutions of the coupled-channel equations are propagated outwards from the classically forbidden region at short range to the asymptotic region. The program calculates scattering S matrices and uses them to calculate scattering properties including elastic, inelastic and line-shape cross sections. Unusual features: 1. molscat contains numerous features to handle quantities important in low-energy collisions. It can propagate very efficiently to very long range, and it can calculate low-energy properties such as the scattering length (complex and energy-dependent if required) and the effective range. 2. molscat can construct and solve sets of coupled equations using basis sets that are not eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonians of the colliding particles at long range. The propagation is carried out in the primitive basis set, and the solutions are transformed to the asymptotic basis set before applying long-range boundary conditions to extract the S matrix. 3. molscat provides an interface that allows users to specify the coupled equations that arise from additional Hamiltonians and basis sets. 4. molscat provides an interface that allows users to include multiple external fields in the Hamiltonian. This same interface also allows users to include a factor which scales the interaction potential, and to investigate how properties vary with this factor. 5. molscat can locate and characterise low-energy Feshbach resonances either as a function of collision energy or as a function of external fields or of the potential scaling factor.}

Using a single step of STIRAP (stimulated Raman adiabatic passage) with two-frequency laser irradiation, we coherently transfer extremely weakly bound KRb molecules to the rovibrational ground state of either the triplet or the singlet electronic ground molecular potential. The polar molecular gas has a peak density of 1012 per cubic centimeter and an expansion-determined translational temperature of 350 nanokelvin. The polar molecules have a permanent electric dipole moment, which we measure with Stark spectroscopy to be 0.052(2) Debye (1 Debye = 3.336 {\texttimes} 10{\textendash}30 coulomb-meters) for the triplet rovibrational ground state and 0.566(17) Debye for the singlet rovibrational ground state.},

Magnetic quantum gases and in particular Dysprosium gases, offering a comparable short-range contact and a long-range dipolar interaction energy, remarkably exhibit such emergent phenomena. In addition an effective cancellation of mean-field effects of the two interactions results in a pronounced importance of quantum-mechanical beyond mean-field effects. For a weakly dominant dipolar interaction the striking consequence is the existence of a new state of matter equilibrated by the balance between weak mean-field attraction and beyond mean-field repulsion. Though exemplified here in the case of dipolar Bose gases, this state of matter should appear also with other microscopic interactions types, provided a competition results in an effective cancellation of the total mean-field. The macroscopic state takes the form of so-called quantum droplets. We present the effects of a long-range dipolar interaction between these droplets.}

Quantum liquids, other than liquid helium, have been comparatively more difficult to come by. Cabrera et al. combined two BECs and manipulated the atomic interactions to create droplets of a quantum liquid (see the Perspective by Ferrier-Barbut and Pfau). Because the interactions were not directional, the droplets had a roughly round shape. The simplicity of this dilute system makes it amenable to theoretical modeling, enabling a better understanding of quantum fluids.Science, this issue p. 301; see also p. 274Quantum droplets are small clusters of atoms self-bound by the balance of attractive and repulsive forces. Here, we report on the observation of droplets solely stabilized by contact interactions in a mixture of two Bose-Einstein condensates. We demonstrate that they are several orders of magnitude more dilute than liquid helium by directly measuring their size and density via in situ imaging. We show that the droplets are stablized against collapse by quantum fluctuations and that they require a minimum atom number to be stable. Below that number, quantum pressure drives a liquid-to-gas transition that we map out as a function of interaction strength. These ultradilute isotropic liquids remain weakly interacting and constitute an ideal platform to benchmark quantum many-body theories.},

By ramping the magnetic field across an interspecies Feshbach resonance (FR), at least 4000 molecules can be produced out of the near degenerate ultracold mixture. Fast loss due to inelastic atom–molecule collisions is observed, which limits the pure molecule number, after residual atoms removal, to 1700. The pure molecule sample can live for 21.8(8) ms in the optical trap, long enough for future molecular spectroscopy studies toward coherently transferring to the singlet ro-vibrational ground state, where these molecules are stable against chemical reaction and have a permanent electric dipole moment of 3.3 Debye. We have also measured the Feshbach molecule’s binding energy near the FR by the oscillating magnetic field method and found these molecules have a large closed-channel fraction.}

	abstract = {Ultracold quantum gases provide a unique setting for studying and understanding the properties of interacting quantum systems. Here, we investigate a multi-component system of 87Rb–39K Bose–Einstein condensates (BECs) with tunable interactions both theoretically and experimentally. Such multi-component systems can be characterized by their miscibility, where miscible components lead to a mixed ground state and immiscible components form a phase-separated state. Here we perform the first full simulation of the dynamical expansion of this system including both BECs and thermal clouds, which allows for a detailed comparison with experimental results. In particular we show that striking features emerge in time-of-flight (TOF) for BECs with strong interspecies repulsion, even for systems which were separated in situ by a large gravitational sag. An analysis of the centre of mass positions of the BECs after expansion yields qualitative agreement with the homogeneous criterion for phase-separation, but reveals no clear transition point between the mixed and the separated phases. Instead one can identify a transition region, for which the presence of a gravitational sag is found to be advantageous. Moreover, we analyse the situation where only one component is condensed and show that the density distribution of the thermal component also shows some distinct features. Our work sheds new light on the analysis of multi-component systems after TOF and will guide future experiments on the detection of miscibility in these systems.}

Due to the limited exposure time available in these systems, the signal-to-noise ratio is largest for high intensity absorption imaging where the intensity of the imaging light is on the order of the saturation intensity. In this case, the absolute value of the intensity of the imaging light enters as an additional parameter making it more sensitive to systematic errors. Here, we present a novel and robust technique to determine the imaging beam intensity in units of the effective saturation intensity to better than 5\&\#x00025;. We do this by measuring the momentum transferred to the atoms by the imaging light while varying its intensity. We further utilize the method to quantify the purity of the polarization of the imaging light and to determine the correct imaging detuning.},

abstract={When atoms in a gas are cooled to extremely low temperatures, they will---under the appropriate conditions---condense into a single quantum-mechanical state known as a Bose--Einstein condensate. In such systems, quantum-mechanical behaviour is evident on a macroscopic scale. Here we explore the dynamics of how a Bose--Einstein condensate collapses and subsequently explodes when the balance of forces governing its size and shape is suddenly altered. A condensate's equilibrium size and shape is strongly affected by the interatomic interactions. Our ability to induce a collapse by switching the interactions from repulsive to attractive by tuning an externally applied magnetic field yields detailed information on the violent collapse process. We observe anisotropic atom bursts that explode from the condensate, atoms leaving the condensate in undetected forms, spikes appearing in the condensate wavefunction and oscillating remnant condensates that survive the collapse. All these processes have curious dependences on time, on the strength of the interaction and on the number of condensate atoms. Although the system would seem to be simple and well characterized, our measurements reveal many phenomena that challenge theoretical models.},
