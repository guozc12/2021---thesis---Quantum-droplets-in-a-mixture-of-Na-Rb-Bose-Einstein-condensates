This chapter discusses the heteronuclear droplets formed by the Bose-Einstein condensate mixture of Na and Rb. We first reanalyze the droplet, however, with a finite volume instead of homogeneous density distribution. This is for comparison with experiments since an actual quantum droplet we build in the experiment always has a specific size due to a limited atomic number. We make a rough estimation by analyzing the energy scales of each term. Then, continuing with the analytical solution in Sec. \ref{sec:droplet_ana}, we implement the variational calculation. We use a simple Gaussian trial function to help understand how different energy scales compete in the finite-size droplets. Its specific size mainly requires introducing a kinetic energy term (i.e. quantum pressure). In order to better understand the droplet sample, we simulate it with extended Gross–Pitaevskii equation (eGPE). In this part, we give the derivation of the extended GPE especially for the two-species BEC sample near zero MF energy region. We put the code of GPELAB \cite{ANTOINE20142969} and samples of the simulation results in the Appendix \ref{chap:eGPELAB} with more details.

% Overview and structure of experiment part of this chapter (done 2021-10-7 22:54:47)
In Sec. \ref{sec:droplet_experiment}, we experimentally study Na-Rb droplet and measure the phase diagram of liquid-gas phase transition, which is the central part of our experimental research. The experimental method is simple and straightforward. We directly let the sample do Time-of-Flight and observe the non-expansion signal. This method avoids the complexity of the optical-levitation method however need more effort to eliminate the inhomogeneity of the magnetic field. In order to cooperate with this scheme, we upgrade our system on both control of magnetic field and imaging method, referring to Sec. \ref{sec:image} and Sec. \ref{sec:fastcoil} for details. Later, in Sec. \ref{sec:LHY_gas}, we study the gaseous LHY sample. This research aims to explore the behaviour of a gaseous sample under the dominance of LHY energy instead of MF energy. This research is a supplement to the study of LHY gas by measuring the trap frequency \cite{skov2020}. After understanding the droplet formation process, we realize that the previous process of preparing droplets is far from adiabatic, which resulted in significant limitations on the sample life and the number of atoms. So we improve the preparation scheme to achieve a droplet sample with more numbers as shown in Sec. \ref{sec:mode_match}. Finally, Sec. \ref{sec:droplet_molecule} shows our efforts on using droplets to form the Feshbach molecules. Although the conversion efficiency has no improvement, we have greatly reduced the temperature of the molecules and provide a promising path for the future production of degenerate Feshbach molecules.


\section{Quantum droplet with finite size}

% overall of this section (done 2021-10-8 09:20:57)
In Sec. \ref{sec:droplet_ana}, we calculate the quantum liquid analytically, showing the mean-field and LHY energy expressions. Then we obtain the equilibrium density of the system. This calculation ignores the system's quantum pressure (kinetic energy), which means it is only proper for homogeneous bulk samples. However, in our experiments, due to the limitation of the atomic number, we currently cannot obtain a sample with a large enough number allowing us to ignore its edge. Thus, in this section, we first analyse the quantum pressure caused by the finite volume then show its influence on the quantum liquid droplet. 

% introducing energy expression
The total energy of the system consists of three parts, in addition to the interaction energy from MF and LHY, there is also the quantum pressure. The expression is as follows
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
E_{\text{kin}}=N \frac{\hbar ^2}{2m}\int \left| \nabla \phi (\pmb{r})\right| ^2 \, dr^3\\
E_{\text{trap}}=N\int \left| \phi (\pmb{r})\right| ^2V_{\text{trap}}(\pmb{r})dr^3,\text{   }V_{\text{trap}}(\pmb{r})=\frac{1}{2}m \omega _0^2\pmb{r}^2\\
E_{\text{MF}}=\frac{g}{2}N^2\int \left| \phi (\pmb{r})\right| ^4 \, dr^3,\text{    }g=\frac{2\pi  \hbar ^2a_S}{m/2}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where ... 什么是什么
局部而言，MF能量正比于n方，LHY正比于n 2.5 次方。动能正比于波函数变化，所以对于homogeneous的bulk sample，这一项是零。但是，考虑到边界上波函数迅速降低（里面density 有限，外面是真空）所以，边界上一定会引入额外的动能，这个动能趋向于让边界变化率降低，也就是变得的更平缓。所以也就趋向于让sampple膨胀。这是经典系统里没有的。另一个被称为表面张力的现象可以用MF enrgy 来解释，在边界上，density 较低，LHY的正的能量相较于MF的吸引能量小很多，所以主要由MF能量主导一个吸引。这个吸引相互作用只发生在density低的边界上，从而构成了表面张力。这一点和经典液体的表面张力成因是一样的。从另一个角度来说MF能量是一个零阶近似，不管是经典还是量子系统都有的。

%继续分析
现在考虑一个有限大小的droplet sample。鉴于上面的分析，如果边界足够大，那么边界上的动能就远小于边界上的MF能，因为总的动能正比于 梯度平方乘上边界大小。而MF正比于边界 什么？ 能不能忽略动能？ ***仔细检查*** 所以，

% quantum droplet with trap
In addition to the quantum droplet of free space, we also discuss the sample of in trap in sec. For the in trap sample, we need to add an additional item of trap energy. So total energy is composed of four parts. For a sample of finite size, trap energy and quantum pressure are just the opposite. Small size introduces higher quantum pressure, but also reduces trap energy, and vice versa. Small size also introduces higher MF and LHY energy. For the sample in the droplet area, MF is negative energy, so MF and LHY compete with each other. Analyzing such a sample with two groups of energies competing with each other is not straightforward. Therefore, the calculation of the variational method we introduced can help us understand the sample in this case very well. This part is explained carefully in sec. For more detailed calculations, please refer to \cite{Liuxiaji2020}.

\section{Variational calculation}

% overall of this section
In this section we introduce the variational calculation of droplet. Variational calculations can help us better understand the results of each energy competition in the system. From the analysis in the previous section, we can already see that no matter the quantum pressure or the interaction energy, in a quantum droplet of finite volume, it is very dependent on the wave function distribution of the system. In places where the changes are severe, that is, at the edges, the quantum pressure is relatively large, and at the same time, the interaction energy (MF and LHY) is low due to the low density. In the middle part of the sample, the density is higher, but the wave function changes smoothly, so the situation is reversed.

% why we use variational method instead of directly using GPE simulation
A more accurate method of simulating the system is to use the finite element method, which treats the entire wave function as a function of space coordinates, and then uses a variational method to adjust the value of the wave function at each spatial position, reducing the energy of the overall system, thereby giving Get a more accurate solution. But this method has two disadvantages. One is that the calculation of the three-dimensional system consumes a lot of computing resources, which is incapable of ordinary personal computers. The second is that simulation does not help us understand the behavioral trends of the system. It's like what social science says, we look at the world with prejudice. Or like the model in the field of machine learning to data. In order to understand the behavior of the system, we need an intermediate model to help us establish the relationship between various causes and effects. After this step, the subsequent GPE simulation will be clearer.

% section structure
In this section, we first review the variational calculation of single species BEC, and then we define what release energy is, and explain how release energy reflects the interaction and the measurement of the second-order correlation function. At the same time, this also gives an experimental measurement method, that is, the direct TOF method. Then we showed the introduction of Gauss variation in the double-species system. Although it is a very rough approximation, it is a good approximation for a case with a relatively small number, because the contribution of the interaction to the system is relatively small. This will be verified in subsequent calculations. We imitate the dimensionless parameters of the single-species BEC, and here introduce two dimensionless parameters to characterize the double-species BEC in the trap. Thereby it is convenient to classify the system.

In this note, we try to calculate two things by variational method: 1. LHY gas in a harmonic trap and the released energy when expansion in freespace. 2. Droplet  with magnetic field gradient and how the critical number shifting. 
We start from Single BEC in a harmonic trap and review the variational method with Gaussian Ansatz. Noted that, we get the $\chi $= - 0.67 there is a collapse point, which offers no solution. Then, we plot the release energy curve. The release energy is just the sum of kinetic energy in trap plus the interaction energy. 
For the Double BEC near MF = 0 point, the behavior of the sample is very similar to a single BEC, as the $\lambda _+$ branch require minimum density, leaving only the $\lambda _-$ branch. So, with the assumption that Na and Rb share the same wave-function, we can just use the result from the Single BEC part. By choosing { }correct characteristic value, we can make comparison for experiment data.
We also use the GPELAB to calculate the release energy, due to Gaussian Ansatz does not fit for large interaction case. We find amazing overlap of our experiment and the GPELAB simulation. The comparison between only MF case and LHY case, we can say that we really measured the LHY energy @zero-MF with a shift from 0.75$\hbar \omega $ to about 1.3$\hbar \omega $. This quite large shift is definite beyond MF theory.
The GPELAB simulation cannot give out physics explanation. However, the variational method can. So, we plot all kinds of energy as a function of the variational parameter $w$. This plot can explain several questions we meet before. 1. How these different energy compete to each other? and what is the meaning of metastable state of droplet? 2. what parameter we need for characterize the LHY term? and how large is this term compare to MF term and others? 3. what will happen if the initial state not match the droplet state? will the expansion over the local maximum and miss the droplet formation?
Finally, we try to add one more variational parameter to the Gaussian Ansatz to explain the shift of critical number when the magnetic field gradient existing. The main idea is Na and Rb wavefunction will surfer a tiny center shifting $\delta $, which actually decrease the absolute value of Mean-Field energy between Na and Rb. Because the $E_{\text{MF$\_$Rb}-\text{Na}}$ is the product of their density. So the overlap will dramatically it. However, The rest part of MF and LHY energy will keep. So, when we are in the droplet region, this gradient will decrease the binding term, which shift the critical number above.

\subsection{Single BEC in harmonic trap}
When we put N Bosons in a harmonic trap with trap frequency of $\omega _0$, we have ground state energy of
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
E_{\text{kin}}=N \frac{\hbar ^2}{2m}\int \left| \nabla \phi (\pmb{r})\right| ^2 \, dr^3\\
E_{\text{trap}}=N\int \left| \phi (\pmb{r})\right| ^2V_{\text{trap}}(\pmb{r})dr^3,\text{   }V_{\text{trap}}(\pmb{r})=\frac{1}{2}m \omega _0^2\pmb{r}^2\\
E_{\text{MF}}=\frac{g}{2}N^2\int \left| \phi (\pmb{r})\right| ^4 \, dr^3,\text{    }g=\frac{2\pi  \hbar ^2a_S}{m/2}
\end{split}
\end{equation}
For convenience we define the harmonic length $a_{\text{ho}}=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar }{m \omega _0}}$.
Now, we use variational method to calculate the wave-function in trap.Typical method is the Gaussian ansatz
\begin{equation}
\phi (\pmb{r})=\frac{1}{\pi^{3/4}\left(w^3a_{\text{ho}}^3\right){}^{1/2}}e^{-\frac{\pmb{r}^2}{2w^2a_{\text{ho}}^2}}
\end{equation}
where the $w$ is the variational parameter. Then, we have
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{MF}}=\frac{g}{2}N^2\int\left|\phi(\pmb{r})\right| ^4 \, dr^3=N \hbar\omega_0\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\frac{a_SN}{a_{\text{ho}}}\frac{1}{w^3}\right)
\end{equation}
i.e. total energy 
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{tot}}[w]=N\hbar\omega_0\left(\frac{3}{4}\frac{1}{w^2}+\frac{3}{4}w^2+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\frac{a_SN}{a_{\text{ho}}}\frac{1}{w^3}\right)
\end{equation}
The method to find ground state is to Minimize the $E_{\text{tot} }$ with the constrain of $\int \phi \phi ^* \, dr^3=N$
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{tot}}[w]-\mu  N=N \hbar  \omega _0\left(\frac{3}{4}\frac{1}{w^2}+\frac{3}{4}w^2+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi }}\frac{a_SN}{a_{\text{ho}}}\frac{1}{w^3}\right)
-\mu  N
\end{equation}
To get the $w$ of ground state, we take the derivative of $E_{\text{tot}}$
\begin{doublespace}
\noindent
\begin{equation}
{\partial _w\left(\frac{3}{4}\frac{1}{w^2}+\frac{3}{4}w^2+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi }}\frac{\chi }{w^3}\right)}
\end{equation}
\end{doublespace}
\begin{doublespace}
\noindent
\begin{equation}
-\frac{3}{2 w^3}+\frac{3 w}{2}-\frac{3 \chi }{\sqrt{2 \pi } w^4}
\end{equation}
\end{doublespace}
where we use $\chi $ represent the dimensionless quantity $\frac{a_SN}{a_{\text{ho}}}$.
With numerical method, we solve out $w$
\begin{doublespace}
\noindent
\begin{equation}
{\text{f1}[\chi \_]\text{:=}\text{NSolve}\left[-\frac{3}{2 w^3}+\frac{3 w}{2}-\frac{3 \chi }{\sqrt{2 \pi } w^4}==0,w\right];}
\end{equation}
\end{doublespace}
From the figure above, we find that for $g=0 \text{case}$, i.e. the non-interacting case, we back to the single particle picture. The wavefunction is a gaussian with size of harmonic length, i.e. $w=1$ With increasing $\chi $, we have larger size (larger $w$), and finally, when reach $\chi >>1$ limit, we turn to the Thomas-Fermi limit.
For $\chi <0$, we have attractive Bose gas, with collapse point at $\chi =-0.671$

\subsection{Release energy}
When we using TOF measurement on condensate from a harmonic trap, we lose the trap energy suddenly and the kinetic energy (quantum pressure) and the interaction energy converts to kinetic energy of motion after long-time evolution.
So, we have the release energy 
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{release}}=E_{\text{kin}}+E_{\text{MF}}=N \hbar  \omega _0\left(\frac{3}{4}\frac{1}{w^2}+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi }}\frac{a_SN}{a_{\text{ho}}}\frac{1}{w^3}\right)
\end{equation}
put the numerical solution of $w$ into the release energy, we have for $g=0 \text{case}$, we have $E_{\text{release}}=\frac{3}{4}\hbar  \omega _0$
With increasing $\chi $, we have larger size (larger $w$), and finally, when reach $\chi >>1$ limit, we turn to the Thomas-Fermi limit.

\subsection{Double BEC in harmonic trap with near zero-MF interaction}
When we put 
$N_{\text{Rb}}$ Rb and $N_{\text{Na}}$ Na in a harmonic trap with trap frequency of $\omega_{\text{Rb}} and \omega _{\text{Na}}$, we have ground state energy of
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{kin}}=N_{\text{Na}} \frac{\hbar ^2}{2m_{\text{Na}}}\int \left\left| \nabla \phi _{\text{Na}}(\pmb{r})\right\right| {}^2 \, dr^3+N_{\text{Rb}}
\frac{\hbar ^2}{2m_{\text{Rb}}}\int \left\left| \nabla \phi _{\text{Rb}}(\pmb{r})\right\right| {}^2 \, dr^3\\
E_{\text{trap}}=N_{\text{Na}}\int \left\left| \phi _{\text{Na}}(\pmb{r})\right\right| {}^2V_{\text{trap}-\text{Na}}(\pmb{r})dr^3+N_{\text{Rb}}\int\left\left| \phi _{\text{Rb}}(\pmb{r})\right\right| {}^2V_{\text{trap}-\text{Rb}}(\pmb{r})dr^3,\text{   }V_{\text{trap}-\text{Rb}}(\pmb{r})=\frac{1}{2}m_{\text{Rb}}\omega _{\text{Rb}}^2\pmb{r}^2\text{  }\text{and}\text{}V_{\text{trap}-\text{Na}}(\pmb{r})=\frac{1}{2}m_{\text{Na}} \omega _{\text{Na}}^2\pmb{r}^2\\
E_{\text{MF}}=\frac{g_{\text{Na}}}{2}N_{\text{Na}}^2\int \left\left| \phi _{\text{Na}}(\pmb{r})\right\right| {}^4 \, dr^3+\frac{g_{\text{Rb}}}{2}N_{\text{Rb}}^2\int
\left\left| \phi _{\text{Rb}}(\pmb{r})\right\right| {}^4 \, dr^3+g_{\text{Rb},\text{Na}}N_{\text{Na}}N_{\text{Rb}}\int \left\left| \phi _{\text{Rb}}(\pmb{r})\right\right|
{}^2\left\left| \phi _{\text{Na}}(\pmb{r})\right\right| {}^2dr^3,\text{    }g_{\text{Rb}}=\frac{2\pi  \hbar ^2a_{\text{Rb}}}{\left.m_{\text{Rb}}\right/2},\text{
    }g_{\text{Na}}=\frac{2\pi  \hbar ^2a_{\text{Na}}}{\left.m_{\text{Na}}\right/2},\text{     }g_{\text{Rb},\text{Na}}=\frac{2\pi  \hbar ^2a_{\text{Rb},\text{Na}}}{m_{\text{Rb}}m_{\text{Na}}/\left(m_{\text{Rb}}+m_{\text{Na}}\right)}\\
E_{\text{LHY}}=\int \frac{256\sqrt{\pi }\hbar ^2}{15}\left(m_{\text{Na}}^{-2/5}a_{\text{Na}}\left\left| \phi _{\text{Na}}(\pmb{r})\right\right| {}^2+m_{\text{Rb}}^{-2/5}a_{\text{Rb}}\left\left|
\phi _{\text{Rb}}(\pmb{r})\right\right| {}^2\right){}^{5/2}dr^3
\end{equation}
As we are dealing with the case of $\text{MF} \text{energy}\to 0$, we can make several approximation:
Two BECs share the same wavefunction $\phi (\pmb{r})$
Gaussian Ansatz as usual.
With the first approximation, we can rewrite the Hamiltonian as
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
E_{\text{kin}}=\left(\frac{N_{\text{Na}}}{m_{\text{Na}}} +\frac{N_{\text{Rb}}}{m_{\text{Rb}}}\right)\frac{\hbar ^2}{2}\int \left| \nabla \phi (\pmb{r})\right|
^2 \, dr^3=\frac{N}{m} \frac{\hbar ^2}{2}\int \left| \nabla \phi (\pmb{r})\right| ^2 \, dr^3\\
E_{\text{trap}}=\frac{1}{2}\left(m_{\text{Rb}} \omega _{\text{Rb}}^2N_{\text{Rb}}+m_{\text{Na}} \omega _{\text{Na}}^2N_{\text{Na}}\right)\int \left|
\phi (\pmb{r})\right| ^2\pmb{r}^2dr^3=\frac{1}{2}m \omega ^2N\int \left| \phi (\pmb{r})\right| ^2\pmb{r}^2dr^3\\
E_{\text{MF}}=\frac{g_{\text{Na}}N_{\text{Na}}^2+g_{\text{Rb}}N_{\text{Rb}}^2+2g_{\text{Rb},\text{Na}}N_{\text{Na}}N_{\text{Rb}}}{2}\int \left| \phi
(\pmb{r})\right| ^4 \, dr^3=\frac{g}{2}N^2\int \left| \phi (\pmb{r})\right| ^4 \, dr^3\\
E_{\text{LHY}}=\frac{8}{15\pi ^2\hbar ^3}\left(m_{\text{Na}}^{3/5}g_{\text{Na}}N_{\text{Na}}+m_{\text{Rb}}^{3/5}g_{\text{Rb}}N_{\text{Rb}}\right){}^{5/2}\int
\left| \phi (\pmb{r})\right| ^5 \, dr^3=\frac{8}{15\pi ^2\hbar ^3}m^{3/2}\Gamma ^{5/2}N^{5/2}\int \left| \phi (r)\right| ^5 \, dr^3
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where, we back to the single component case, with new mass, number, trap frequency and interaction following \pmb{ the negative branch} in \textit{Petrov 2015, i.e.}
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{MF}-}=\lambda _-n_-^2, \text{with} \lambda _-=\frac{\text{$\delta$g}\sqrt{g_{\text{Rb}}g_{\text{Na}}}}{\left(g_{\text{Na}}+g_{\text{Rb}}\right)}\text{and} n_-=\frac{n_{\text{Rb}}\sqrt{g_{\text{Na}}}+n_{\text{Na}}\sqrt{g_{\text{Rb}}}}{\sqrt{g_{\text{Na}}+g_{\text{Rb}}}}
\end{equation}
Thus, we can define the new number and interaction strength as
\begin{equation}
N=N_-=\frac{N_{\text{Rb}}\sqrt{g_{\text{Na}}}+N_{\text{Na}}\sqrt{g_{\text{Rb}}}}{\sqrt{g_{\text{Na}}+g_{\text{Rb}}}}\\
g=2\lambda _-=\frac{2\text{$\delta $g}\sqrt{g_{\text{Rb}}g_{\text{Na}}}}{\left(g_{\text{Na}}+g_{\text{Rb}}\right)},\text{  }\text{$\delta $g}=g_{\text{Rb},\text{Na}}+\sqrt{g_{\text{Rb}}g_{\text{Na}}}\\
g=\frac{4\pi  \hbar ^2a_S}{m}
\end{equation}
Then, we have
\begin{equation}
m=\frac{N m_{\text{Na}}m_{\text{Rb}}}{N_{\text{Na}}m_{\text{Rb}}+N_{\text{Rb}}m_{\text{Na}}}\\
\omega =\sqrt{\frac{\left(N_{\text{Na}}m_{\text{Rb}}+N_{\text{Rb}}m_{\text{Na}}\right)\left(m_{\text{Rb}} \omega _{\text{Rb}}^2N_{\text{Rb}}+m_{\text{Na}}
\omega _{\text{Na}}^2N_{\text{Na}}\right)}{N^2m_{\text{Na}}m_{\text{Rb}}}}\\
\Gamma =\frac{m_{\text{Na}}^{3/5}g_{\text{Na}}N_{\text{Na}}+m_{\text{Rb}}^{3/5}g_{\text{Rb}}N_{\text{Rb}}}{m^{3/5}N}=\frac{4\pi  \hbar ^2A}{m}
\end{equation}
For convenience we define the harmonic length
\begin{equation}
a_{\text{ho}}=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar }{m \omega }}=\sqrt{\hbar \sqrt{\frac{N_{\text{Na}}m_{\text{Rb}}+N_{\text{Rb}}m_{\text{Na}}}{\left(m_{\text{Rb}}
\omega _{\text{Rb}}^2N_{\text{Rb}}+m_{\text{Na}} \omega _{\text{Na}}^2N_{\text{Na}}\right)m_{\text{Na}}m_{\text{Rb}}}}}
\end{equation}

With Gaussian Ansatz

\begin{equation}\phi (\pmb{r})=\frac{1}{\pi ^{3/4}\left(w^3a_{\text{ho}}^3\right){}^{1/2}}e^{-\frac{\pmb{r}^2}{2w^2a_{\text{ho}}^2}}\end{equation}

Finally, we get the same formula as the single BEC near MF zero point, and its total energy is

\begin{equation}E_{\text{tot}}[w]=N \hbar  \omega  \left(\frac{3}{4}\frac{1}{w^2}+\frac{3}{4}w^2+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi }}\frac{a_SN}{a_{\text{ho}}}\frac{1}{w^3}+\frac{512
}{75 \pi ^{7/4}}\sqrt{\frac{2}{5}}\left(\frac{A}{a_{\text{ho}}}\right){}^{5/2}N^{3/2}\frac{1}{ w^{9/2}}\right)\end{equation}

i.e.

\begin{equation}\text{}\\
\text{where}\text{    }\chi =\frac{a_SN}{a_{\text{ho}}}, \xi =\left(\frac{A}{a_{\text{ho}}}\right){}^{5/2}N^{3/2}\end{equation}

Released energy is

\begin{equation}E_{\text{release}}=\frac{\left(\frac{3}{2}m_{\text{Rb}}N_{\text{Rb}}v_{\text{Rb}}^2+\frac{3}{2}m_{\text{Na}}N_{\text{Na}}v_{\text{Na}}^2\right)}{N}\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\frac{E_{\text{release}}}{\hbar  \omega _{\text{ho}}}=\\
\frac{\left(\frac{3}{2}m_{\text{Rb}}N_{\text{Rb}}v_{\text{Rb}}^2+\frac{3}{2}m_{\text{Na}}N_{\text{Na}}v_{\text{Na}}^2\right)}{N}\frac{1}{\hbar \sqrt{\frac{\left(N_{\text{Na}}m_{\text{Rb}}+N_{\text{Rb}}m_{\text{Na}}\right)\left(m_{\text{Rb}}
\omega _{\text{Rb}}^2N_{\text{Rb}}+m_{\text{Na}} \omega _{\text{Na}}^2N_{\text{Na}}\right)}{N^2m_{\text{Na}}m_{\text{Rb}}}}}=\frac{\left(m_{\text{Rb}}N_{\text{Rb}}v_{\text{Rb}}^2+m_{\text{Na}}N_{\text{Na}}v_{\text{Na}}^2\right)}{2\hbar
}\frac{3\sqrt{m_{\text{Na}}m_{\text{Rb}}}}{\sqrt{\left(N_{\text{Na}}m_{\text{Rb}}+N_{\text{Rb}}m_{\text{Na}}\right)\left(m_{\text{Rb}} \omega _{\text{Rb}}^2N_{\text{Rb}}+m_{\text{Na}}

about the $\chi $

\begin{equation}\chi =\frac{a_SN}{a_{\text{ho}}}=\frac{g \frac{m_{\text{Na}}m_{\text{Rb}}}{N_{\text{Na}}m_{\text{Rb}}+N_{\text{Rb}}m_{\text{Na}}}}{4\pi  \hbar

\begin{equation}\text{}\end{equation}


When we put $N_{\text{Rb}}$ Rb and $N_{\text{Na}}$ Na in a harmonic trap with trap frequency of $\omega _{\text{Rb}}$ and $\omega _{\text{Na}}$,
we have ground state energy of

Finally, we get the same formula as the single BEC near MF zero point, and its total energy is

E_{\text{tot}}[w]=N \hbar  \omega  \left(\frac{3}{4}\frac{1}{w^2}+\frac{3}{4}w^2+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi }}\frac{a_SN}{a_{\text{ho}}}\frac{1}{w^3}+\frac{512}{75 \pi^{7/4}}\sqrt{\frac{2}{5}}\left(\frac{A}{a_{\text{ho}}}\right){}^{5/2}N^{3/2}\frac{1}{ w^{9/2}}\right)
\end{equation}
i.e. where
\begin{equation}
\chi =\frac{a_SN}{a_{\text{ho}}}, \xi =\left(\frac{A}{a_{\text{ho}}}\right){}^{5/2}N^{3/2}
\end{equation}
Released energy is

E_{\text{release}}=\frac{\left(\frac{3}{2}m_{\text{Rb}}N_{\text{Rb}}v_{\text{Rb}}^2+\frac{3}{2}m_{\text{Na}}N_{\text{Na}}v_{\text{Na}}^2\right)}{N}

\subsection{How magnetic field gradient affect droplet}

When we put $N_{\text{Rb}}$ Rb and $N_{\text{Na}}$ Na in free space, with magnetic gradient $\nabla $B, we take the center-of-mass as original point.
Consider gradient force
\begin{equation}
F=N_{\text{Rb}}\mu _{\text{Rb}}\nabla B+N_{\text{Na}}\mu _{\text{Na}}\nabla B
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{A}_{\text{center} \text{of} \text{mass}}=F/m=\frac{N_{\text{Rb}}\mu _{\text{Rb}}+N_{\text{Na}}\mu _{\text{Na}}}{N_{\text{Rb}}m_{\text{Rb}}+N_{\text{Na}}m_{\text{Na}}}\nabla B
\end{equation}
So, in the coordinate of center of mass, we have
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{A}_{\text{Rb}}=\frac{\mu _{\text{Rb}}\nabla B}{m_{\text{Rb}}}-\frac{N_{\text{Rb}}\mu _{\text{Rb}}\nabla B+N_{\text{Na}}\mu _{\text{Na}}\nabla
B}{N_{\text{Rb}}m_{\text{Rb}}+N_{\text{Na}}m_{\text{Na}}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{A}_{\text{Na}}=\frac{\mu _{\text{Na}}\nabla B}{m_{\text{Na}}}-\frac{N_{\text{Rb}}\mu _{\text{Rb}}\nabla B+N_{\text{Na}}\mu _{\text{Na}}\nabla
B}{N_{\text{Rb}}m_{\text{Rb}}+N_{\text{Na}}m_{\text{Na}}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}
Gaussian Ansatz with shifts
\begin{equation}
\phi _{\text{Na}}(x,y,z)=\frac{1}{\pi ^{3/4}\left(w^3a_{\text{ho}}^3\right){}^{1/2}}e^{-\frac{x^2+\left(y-\frac{m_{\text{Rb}}N_{\text{Rb}}\delta

_y}{m_{\text{Rb}}N_{\text{Rb}}+m_{\text{Na}}N_{\text{Na}}}\right){}^2+z^2}{2w^2a_{\text{ho}}^2}}\end{equation}

Then, we have 

\begin{equation}E_{\text{kin}}=N_{\text{Na}} \frac{\hbar ^2}{2m_{\text{Na}}}\int \left\left| \nabla \phi _{\text{Na}}(\pmb{r})\right\right| {}^2 \, dr^3+N_{\text{Rb}}

Put the center shift Gaussian into it, we have

\begin{equation}
E_{\text{tot}}[w]=N \hbar\omega\left(\left(-\mu_{\text{eff}}\nablaB\right)\delta +\frac{3}{4}\frac{1}{w^2}+\frac{3}{4}w^2+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\frac{a_SN}{a_{\text{ho}}}\frac{1}{w^3}\left(\lambdae^{-\delta^2}\right)+\frac{512}{75\pi^{7/4}}\sqrt{\frac{2}{5}}\left(\frac{A}{a_{\text{ho}}}\right){}^{5/2}N^{3/2}\frac{1}{w^{9/2}}\right)
\end{equation}
When, $\delta $ is a small value, we have $e^{-\delta ^2}=1-\delta ^2$, thus we have
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{tot}}[w]=N \hbar  \omega  \left[\left(\frac{3}{4}\frac{1}{w^2}+\frac{3}{4}w^2+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi }}\chi \frac{1}{w^3}+\frac{512 }{75
\pi ^{7/4}}\sqrt{\frac{2}{5}}\xi  \frac{1}{ w^{9/2}}\right) +\lambda  \delta ^2-\left(\mu _{\text{eff}}\nabla B\right) \delta \right]\\
\text{where}\text{    }\chi =\frac{a_SN}{a_{\text{ho}}}, \xi =\left(\frac{A}{a_{\text{ho}}}\right){}^{5/2}N^{3/2}
\end{equation}

更加精细的变分函数的使用可以获得更精确的解。

\section{extended GPE solution}

% overall of this section
Although the variational method used in the previous section provides a general physical image, because we use a rough gauss function, the method will get meaningless results when the system deviates from the reasonable parameter interval. So we need more accurate numerical calculations to compare with experimental data. In view of the fact that quantum depletion is still a very low part of our system, it is more reasonable to use local density approximation to calculate the wave function of the condensate part. Therefore, we only need to add LHY correctin to MF shift as a high-level correction. Then use this extended GPE to calculate the system to get the condensate wave function of the system.

% adopt Minardi approximation
In this section, let us first revisit the calculation of MF and LHY correction of the double BEC system. Then we give the derivation of extended GPE. We first give the derivation of single species GPE. Then imitating this process, the derivation of the extended GPE of double-species is given. When calculating the LHY correction, if we adopt the method of infinite integration, the amount of calculation will increase. So we imitated Minardi's paper and adopted an approximation with an error of less than 5\%. The rationality of this approximation essentially stems from the symmetry of the two species (and check the paper to check this)


Hamiltonian for BEC with two components is
\begin{equation}H_{\text{tot}}=\sum _k \epsilon _{1,k}\hat{a}_{1,k}\dagger\hat{a}_{1,k}+\frac{g_{11}}{2V}\sum _{\left\{k_i\right\}} \hat{a}_{1,k_1}^+\hat{a}_{1,k_2}^+\hat{a}_{1,k_3}\hat{a}_{1,k_4}+\sum
_k \epsilon _{2,k}\hat{a}_{2,k}\dagger\hat{a}_{2,k}+\frac{g_{22}}{2V}\sum _{\left\{k_i\right\}} \hat{a}_{2,k_1}^+\hat{a}_{2,k_2}^+\hat{a}_{2,k_3}\hat{a}_{2,k_4}+\frac{g_{12}}{V}\sum
_{\left\{k_i\right\}} \hat{a}_{2,k_1}^+\hat{a}_{1,k_2}^+\hat{a}_{1,k_3}\hat{a}_{2,k_4}\end{equation}

where $k_1+k_2=k_3+k_4$, satisfy momentum conservation. $g_{\text{ii}}$ represent intra-interaction strength, and $g_{12}$ for inter-interaction. $\hat{a}_{i,k}^+$($\hat{a}_{i,k}$) denote the ladder operator for $i^{\text{th}}$ component. $\hat{a}_{i,0}=\sqrt{N_i}$
After extended Bogoliubov transformation, we have
\begin{equation}
H=\frac{g_{11}N_1^2+g_{22}N_2^2+2g_{12}N_1N_2}{2V}+\frac{1}{2}\sum _{k\neq 0} \left(E_++E_--\frac{\hbar ^2k^2}{2m_1}-\frac{\hbar ^2k^2}{2m_2}-\frac{g_{11}N_1+g_{22}N_2}{V}\right)+\sum
_{k\neq 0} E_{+,k}\hat{a}_{+,k}\dagger\hat{a}_{+,k}+\sum _{k\neq 0} E_{-,k}\hat{a}_{-,k}\dagger\hat{a}_{-,k}
\end{equation}
where first term gives mean-field ground state energy; second term gives LHY correction; last two terms provide two branches of excitation spectrum. Details of parameters in above formula are listed here:
\begin{equation}
E_{\pm }=\sqrt{\frac{\omega_1^2+\omega_2^2}{2}\pm\sqrt{\left(\frac{\omega_1^2-\omega_2^2}{2}\right){}^2+\frac{g_{12}^2N_1N_2}{V^2}\frac{\hbar^2k^4}{m_1m_2}}}\\
\omega _i=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar ^2k^2}{2m_i}\left(\frac{\hbar ^2k^2}{2m_i}+\frac{2g_{\text{ii}}N_i}{V}\right)}
\end{equation}
Ground state energy is
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{GS}}=\frac{g_{11}N_1^2+g_{22}N_2^2+2g_{12}N_1N_2}{2V}+\frac{1}{2}\sum _{k\neq 0} \left(E_++E_--\frac{\hbar ^2k^2}{2m_1}-\frac{\hbar ^2k^2}{2m_2}-\frac{g_{11}N_1+g_{22}N_2}{V}\right)
\end{equation}
After re-normalization we have the second term, LHY term, which can be rewritten with (4) in
\begin{equation}
E_{\text{LHY}}=\frac{1}{2}\sum _{k\neq 0} \left(\sqrt{\frac{\omega _1^2+\omega _2^2}{2}+\sqrt{\left(\frac{\omega _1^2-\omega _2^2}{2}\right){}^2+g_{12}^2n_1n_2\frac{\hbar^4k^4}{m_1m_2}}}+\right.\\
\left.\sqrt{\frac{\omega _1^2+\omega _2^2}{2}-\sqrt{\left(\frac{\omega _1^2-\omega _2^2}{2}\right){}^2+g_{12}^2n_1n_2\frac{\hbar ^4k^4}{m_1m_2}}}-\frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m_1}-\frac{\hbar ^2k^2}{2m_2}-g_{11}n_1-g_{22}n_2+\frac{m_1g_{11}^2n_1^2+m_2g_{22}^2n_2^2+4\frac{m_1m_2}{m_1+ m_2}g_{12}^2n_1n_2}{\hbar ^2k^2}\right)
\end{equation}
Replace summation by integral ($\sum _k \to V\int d\pmb{\overset{\rightharpoonup }{\pmb{k}}}$), we have
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}_{\text{LHY}}=\frac{E_{\text{LHY}}}{V}=\int_0^{k_c\to\infty}\frac{k^2}{4\pi^2}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\omega_1^2+\omega_2^2}{2}+\sqrt{\left(\frac{\omega_1^2-\omega_2^2}{2}\right){}^2+g_{12}^2n_1n_2\frac{\hbar^4k^4}{m_1m_2}}}+\right.\\
\left.\sqrt{\frac{\omega_1^2+\omega_2^2}{2}-\sqrt{\left(\frac{\omega_1^2-\omega _2^2}{2}\right){}^2+g_{12}^2n_1n_2\frac{\hbar^4k^4}{m_1m_2}}}-\frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m_1}-\frac{\hbar^2k^2}{2m_2}-g_{11}n_1-g_{22}n_2+\frac{m_1g_{11}^2n_1^2+m_2g_{22}^2n_2^2+4\frac{m_1m_2}{m_1+m_2}g_{12}^2n_1n_2}{\hbar^2k^2}\right)dk
\end{equation}

For simplicity, we reform it into dimensionless form

\begin{equation}\mathcal{E}_{\text{LHY}}=C_1\int _0^{k_c}\frac{15}{32}\tilde{k}^2\left(\surd \left(\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\tilde{k}^2}{2}\left(\frac{\tilde{k}^2}{2}+2\right)+\frac{1}{\gamma
^2}\frac{\tilde{k}^2}{2}\left(\frac{\tilde{k}^2}{2}+2y \gamma \right)\right)+\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\tilde{k}^2}{2}\left(\frac{\tilde{k}^2}{2}+2\right)-\frac{1}{\gamma
^2}\frac{\tilde{k}^2}{2}\left(\frac{\tilde{k}^2}{2}+2y \gamma \right)\right)\right)^2+\frac{x y}{\gamma }\tilde{k}^4}\right)+\right.\\
\left.\surd \left(\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\tilde{k}^2}{2}\left(\frac{\tilde{k}^2}{2}+2\right)+\frac{1}{\gamma ^2}\frac{\tilde{k}^2}{2}\left(\frac{\tilde{k}^2}{2}+2y
\gamma \right)\right)-\sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\tilde{k}^2}{2}\left(\frac{\tilde{k}^2}{2}+2\right)-\frac{1}{\gamma ^2}\frac{\tilde{k}^2}{2}\left(\frac{\tilde{k}^2}{2}+2y
\gamma \right)\right)\right)^2+\frac{x y}{\gamma }\tilde{k}^4}\right)-\frac{\tilde{k}^2}{2}\left(1+\frac{1}{\gamma }\right)-1-y+\frac{1+\gamma  y^2+\frac{4x
y \gamma }{1+\gamma }}{\tilde{k}^2}\right)d\tilde{k}\end{equation}

where

\begin{equation}C_1=\frac{8}{15\pi ^2}g_{11}n_1\left(\frac{\sqrt{m_1g_{11}n_1}}{\hbar }\right){}^3, \gamma =\frac{m_2}{m_1}, x=\frac{g_{12}^2}{g_{11}g_{22}}, y=\frac{g_{22}n_2}{g_{11}n_1},
\tilde{k}=\frac{\hbar  k}{\sqrt{m_1g_{11}n_1}}\end{equation}

using \begin{equation}f\left(\frac{m_2}{m_1},\frac{g_{12}^2}{g_{11}g_{22}},\frac{g_{22}n_2}{g_{11}n_1}\right)\end{equation} replacing the tedious integral, we have

\begin{equation}\mathcal{E}_{\text{LHY}}=\frac{8}{15\pi ^2}\frac{m_1^{3/2}\left(g_{11}n_1\right){}^{5/2}}{\hbar ^3}f(\gamma ,x,y)\end{equation}


In this section, we will calculate $f(\gamma ,x,y)$ numerically for our Rb-Na Bose mixture system.
First we do this integration and check its convergence. We plot $f(\gamma ,x,y)$ with increasing upper bound of integration $k_C$ to test its convergence.
We can say that integration up to order of 6 has converged. 
Then, we calculate $f(\gamma ,x,y)$ with different $x$, i.e. with different B-field
Compare with Minardi's approximation
In Minardi's paper [\textit{ 2019 - F.Minardi - M.Modugno - Effective expression of the Lee-Huang-Yang energy functional for heteronuclear mixtures}],they propose a analytical approximation which will be more convenient for deriving GPE with LHY correction. Here is the formula:
\begin{equation}
f(z,u=1,x)\simeq \left(1+z^{3/5}x\right)^{5/2}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
z=m_2/m_1, x=\frac{g_{22}n_2}{g_{11}n_1},u=\frac{g_{12}^2}{g_{11}g_{22}}
\end{equation}
Here, $u$ is set to be 1.
Now, we compare the numerical solution with the Minardi's approximation.
Plot of List of f($\gamma $,x,y) for numerical one and Minardi's approximation.
So, we can see that, there are mainly several percentage error by using this formula. And the maximum error is about 15$\%$. So, keep this error
in mind about the LHY energy.

\subsection{Derivation of GPE for single species BEC}

First, we assume the many-body wave function is a product state
\begin{equation}
\Psi \left(\overset{\rightharpoonup }{r}_1,\overset{\rightharpoonup }{r}_2,\ldots  ,\overset{\rightharpoonup }{r}_N\right)=\sum _{i=1}^N \psi \left(\overset{\rightharpoonup}{r}_i\right)
\end{equation}
Then, we have
\begin{equation}
E\left(\psi ,\psi ^*\right)=N\int dr^3\left(\frac{\hbar ^2}{2m}\left| \nabla \psi (r)\right| ^2+V(r)\left| \psi (r)\right| ^2+\frac{1}{2}N g\left|\psi (r)\right| ^4\right)
\end{equation}
define the Variation
\begin{equation}X\left(\psi ,\psi ^*\right)=E\left(\psi ,\psi ^*\right)-\mu  N\int dr^3\left| \psi (r)\right| ^2\end{equation}

take the variation of $X\left(\psi ,\psi ^*\right)$, we have

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\delta  X\left(\psi ,\psi ^*\right)&=N\int dr^3\left(\frac{\hbar ^2}{2m}\left(\nabla \psi ^*(r)\nabla \delta \psi (r)+\nabla \psi (r)\nabla \delta \psi ^*(r)\right)+(V(r)-\mu )\left(\psi ^*(r)\delta  \psi (r)+\psi (r)\delta  \psi ^*(r) \right)+N g\left(\psi ^2(r)\delta  \psi ^*(r)+\psi ^*^2(r)\delta\psi (r)\right)\right)\\
&=N\int dr^3\left(\frac{\hbar ^2}{2m}\left(\nabla \psi (r)\nabla \delta \psi ^*(r)\right)+(V(r)-\mu )\left(\psi (r)\delta  \psi ^*(r) \right)+N g\left(\psi
^2(r)\psi ^*(r)\delta  \psi ^*(r)\right)\right)+c.c.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
for the first part, by using integrating by part method:
\begin{equation}
\int dr^3\left(\nabla \psi (r)\nabla \delta \psi ^*(r)\right)=\delta \psi ^*(r)\nabla \psi (r)|_0^{\infty }-\int dr^3\left(\nabla ^2\psi (r)\delta

\section{Na-Rb Hetero-nuclear quantum droplet}
\label{sec:droplet_experiment}

Our experiment starts from an optically trapped double BEC of $^{23}$Na and $^{87}$Rb (denoted as species 1 and 2 hereafter, respectively) both prepared in their lowest-energy hyperfine Zeeman level $\ket{F = 1, m_F = 1}$~\cite{wang2015double}. To reveal the LHY effects, we focus on the near-zero MF region with $\delta g = g_{12} + \sqrt{g_{11} g_{22}} \approx 0$. Here $g_{ij} = 2\pi\hbar^2 a_{ij}/M_{ij}$ are the two-body interaction constants, with $a_{ij}$ the scattering lengths and $M_{ij}$ the reduced masses. To reach this regime, we use the Na-Rb Feshbach resonance at $B_0 = 347.648$~G to tune the Na-Rb scattering length. The scattering length is represented as $a_{12} = a_\text{bg}\big(1-\Delta/(B-B_0)\big)$ [upper panel of Fig.~\ref{fig1}(a)], with background scattering length $a_\text{bg} = 76.33a_0$ and resonance width $\Delta = 4.255$~G~\cite{Wang2013,note1}. Near $B_0$ the intraspecies scattering lengths $a_{11} = 60.05a_0$~\cite{Knoop2011,SM} and $a_{22} = 100.13a_0$~\cite{Kempen2002,SM} remain almost constant.

For convenience, we define a dimensionless parameter $\widetilde{\delta g} \equiv \delta g/\overline{g}$ to characterize the total $E_{\rm MF}$, with $\overline{g} = (g_{11}+g_{22})/2$. For the current system, the critical magnetic field for $\widetilde{\delta g} = 0$ (and also $\delta g= 0$) is $B_c = 349.978$~G, which corresponds to a critical interspecies scattering length $a^c_{12} = -63.1 a_0$. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig1}(a) (lower panel), for each value of $\widetilde{\delta g} < 0$, the double BEC will undergo a transition from gas phase to droplet phase as the atom numbers are increased. With our atom numbers around $10^4$ for both species, the theory predicts an observation window for the droplet phase for $\widetilde{\delta g}$ from $-0.061$ to $-0.189$ (349.910 G to 349.780 G). For $\widetilde{\delta g}$ from 0 to $-0.061$, droplet formation is still possible but atom numbers much larger than currently available are needed.

\subsection{Experiment method and time sequence}


%imaging method
In the first experiment, we study the Na-Rb quantum droplet in free space 
by releasing the sample from the optical trap. We probe the system during the time of flight (TOF), as depicted in the inset of Fig.~\ref{fig1}(a).
To probe the atoms in situ at each TOF, we implement a two-species high-field detection protocol which consists of a partial optical pumping process followed by standard absorption imaging on the cycling transitions~\cite{Jia2020}.
This partial imaging method is necessary as the droplets have very high optical depth and are difficult to detect directly~\cite{ramanathan2012partial,semeghini2018self}. Both the partial optical pumping and the absorption imaging are calibrated using standard methods~\cite{reinaudi2007strong,hueck2017calibrating}. The measured resolutions ($1/\sqrt{e}$ half Gaussian widths) of our imaging system are $0.6~\mu$m and $0.8~\mu$m for $^{23}$Na at 589 nm and $^{87}$Rb at 780 nm, respectively, which are just enough to resolve the droplet. 
To maintain the imaging resolutions, we mount the objective and the probe 
light optics on high-precision vertical translational stages to keep the optical axis of the imaging system always aligned with the droplet.

%experiment method and time sequence
While shutting down the optical trap provides a direct way of probing the droplet in free space, the non-adiabatic nature of the process can cause problems.
Due to the confinement, the in-trap sample is smaller in size than the free-space droplet in its ground state, while the total energy of the system is much larger. In the worst scenario, the energy of the initial state upon release from the trap is larger then the energy barrier of the
expansion and a stable droplet can never be formed~\cite{SM}. To mitigate this problem, the crossed optical dipole trap is configured in a nearly spherical shape with measured trap oscillation frequencies of 78 Hz (86 Hz) for $^{87}$Rb ($^{23}$Na). This is in accordance with the understanding that a quantum droplet with isotropic short-range interactions should be spherical in free space. In addition, a carefully designed magnetic field control sequence is used to improve the mode matching~\cite{SM}. These steps allow us to observe droplet formation reliably for $\widetilde{\delta g}$ from $-0.094$ to $-0.189$. However, for $\widetilde{\delta g}$ from $-0.061$ to $-0.094$, due to the smaller binding energy, droplets can be observed only by a more sophisticated mode-matching method, aided by fast magnetic field quenching at the instant of releasing the samples from the trap~\cite{SM}. For this method to work, the starting magnetic field must be selected carefully so that the size of the in-trap sample matches that of the free-space droplet at the end of the magnetic field quenching.

\subsection{observing non-expansion signal}

Figure~\ref{fig1}(b) shows a side-by-side comparison of the $^{23}$Na and $^{87}$Rb clouds in the gas phase and the droplet phase following the TOF.
The signature self-bound behavior of the droplet can be observed clearly by comparing its dramatically different TOF expansion with that in the gas phase.
For $\widetilde{\delta g}=-0.119$ (349.849 G), where the droplet phase is expected, the sizes of both clouds stay nearly the same during the TOF.
For $\widetilde{\delta g}=+0.344$ (350.451 G), by contrast, the system remains in the gas phase, and the sizes increase steadily with TOF.

% fitting by Gaussian and double-Gaussian
To extract quantitative information, we fit the images with 2D Gaussian functions.
In the droplet, the size should be the same for the two species; their densities and thus numbers should follow the ratio $N_{2}/N_{1} 
= \sqrt{g_{11}/g_{22}}=1.51$~\cite{petrov2015}. When this ratio is not maintained, the droplet part shows up as a dense central peak, and the excess atoms of one species appear as a much larger-sized and expanding gaseous background surrounding the droplet [inset of Fig.~\ref{fig1}(c)].
For this kind of ``bimodal'' distribution, the droplet parameters are extracted with a double 2D Gaussian fitting. Fig.~\ref{fig1}(c) shows the starkly different expansion behaviors in the droplet and the gas phases obtained from the images in Fig.~\ref{fig1}(b).

%Explanation of Fig#2
%droplet formation
For the droplets formed by direct trap release from $\widetilde{\delta g} = -0.094$ to $-0.189$, we observe two distinctively different dynamics in the evolution of the $^{23}$Na and $^{87}$Rb samples during the TOF. As an example, Fig.~\ref{fig2}(a), (b) and (c) show the sizes, atom numbers, and number ratio of the droplet sample for $\widetilde{\delta g}=-0.116$ (349.852~G).
During the first 10 ms, the $^{23}$Na and $^{87}$Rb sizes increase very little, while atom losses are observed for both species.
Bimodal distributions are observed from 0 ms to 5 ms as the initial number ratio is far from 1.51. After 5 ms expansion, the gaseous atoms surrounding the droplet are already too dilute to be detected. 

%droplet to the gas phase transition
After about 10 ms, the sample sizes start to increase while the atom numbers stay nearly constant.
This is consistent with a phase transition from droplet to gas when the atom numbers are reduced to below the critical values [see Fig.~\ref{fig1}(a)]. We fit the size evolution empirically with $\sigma(t>t_0)=\sqrt{\sigma_0^2+v^2(t-t_0)^2}$ and $\sigma(t<t_0)=\sigma_0$, and obtain a lifetime in the droplet phase of about $t_0 = 7$ ms. Here $v$ is the expansion velocity of the gas-phase sample. Similarly, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig2}(b), the critical atom numbers for the phase transition can be obtained by fitting the $^{23}$Na and $^{87}$Rb number evolution data with an 
exponential decay function with the critical number as the offset.

For several values of $\widetilde{\delta g}$ between $-0.061$ and $-0.094$, we have created longer-lived droplets by the magnetic field quenching method. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig2}(d), (e) and (f), during the accessible TOF, the droplet size stays nearly the same although number losses are still observed. After 10 ms, the number ratio becomes close to 1.51 and the number loss slows down significantly. As the lifetime is longer than the usable TOF 
of 18 ms, we have not been able to measure the real lifetime and the critical numbers in this range of $\widetilde{\delta g}$. More detailed investigations, e.g., by levitating the droplet, are warranted in the near future.


\subsection{Characterization of liquid-gas phase transition}

An important technical issue for observing the free-space droplet is the spatial varying magnetic field experienced by the droplet during the TOF. 
Due to the different magnetic dipole moments of $^{23}$Na ($\mu_{b1} = 1.084$ MHz/G) and $^{87}$Rb ($\mu_{b2} = 0.837$ MHz/G) near $B_0$, a moderate gradient and curvature may generate a differential force large enough to tear the droplet apart. With the pair of Feshbach coils only, the measured magnetic field curvature near 347 G is 1.4 G/cm$^2$ and the averaged magnetic field gradient is about 0.6 G/cm. Experimentally, we observe the $^{23}$Na and $^{87}$Rb atomic clouds separating from each other following the TOF. To mitigate this problem, we placed another coil, with its current dynamically controlled following the TOF, on top of the Feshbach coil.
This simple improvement reduces the magnetic field gradient to 0.11 G/cm and the magnetic field variation during the 18 ms TOF from $\pm 10$~mG to 
$\pm 3$~mG which corresponds to a $a_{12}$ change of less than 0.26 $a_0$.

\end{figure}

In the eGPEs, the magnetic field gradient is included as opposite direction linear potentials to the two species in the center-of-mass coordinate. 
According to the simulation, this small magnetic field gradient actually doubles the critical atom numbers.

For several values of $\widetilde{\delta g}$ between $-0.110$ and $-0.146$, we have created longer-lived droplets by the magnetic field quenching method. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig2}(d), (e) and (f), during the accessible TOF, the droplet size stays nearly the same although number losses are still observed. After 10 ms, the number ratio becomes close to 1.43 and the number loss slows down significantly. As the lifetime is longer than the usable TOF 
of 18 ms, we have not been able to measure the real lifetime and the critical numbers in this range of $\widetilde{\delta g}$. More detailed investigations, e.g., by levitating the droplet, are warranted in the near future.




Figure~\ref{fig3} shows the critical $^{23}$Na and $^{87}$Rb atom numbers for $\widetilde{\delta g}$ from $-0.146$ to $-0.247$.
Although the range of $\widetilde{\delta g}$ is small, a four-fold change in the measured critical numbers is observed. 
The critical numbers calculated using coupled eGPEs with the LHY term included (dashed curves) show large discrepancies with the measurements. The agreement is greatly improved by also including the small post-compensation residual magnetic field gradient in the eGPEs (solid curves); the additional term nearly doubles  the critical numbers. This can be understood from the different magnetic dipole moments and masses of $^{23}$Na and $^{87}$Rb, which cause their centers of mass to separate in a magnetic field gradient~\cite{SM}. This decreases the density overlap and lowers the attractive interspecies mean-field energy while leaving the intraspecies energy nearly intact. Effectively, this increases the critical numbers compared to the ideal case of zero gradient.

% about loss
A major cause of the atom losses is three-body recombination as a result of the high number densities in the droplet~\cite{cabrera2018quantum,semeghini2018self,DErrico2019,SM}. For droplets with $\widetilde{\delta g}$ from $-0.094$ to $-0.189$, another possible loss mechanism is self-evaporation due to the imperfect matching between in-trap and free-space modes~\cite{Ferioli2020}. The short lifetimes in this region are the combined result of these loss mechanisms. In contrast, the droplet at $\widetilde{\delta g} = -0.089$ [see Fig.~\ref{fig2}(d), (e), and (f)] has relatively lower number densities and is formed with nearly optimal mode matching, and is thus longer lived. Nevertheless, for both cases, the stabilized number ratios after 10 ms TOF are very close to 1.51 despite the different creation procedures and the large initial number mismatches [Fig.~\ref{fig2}(c) and (f)].

\section{Lee-Huang-Yang gas}
\label{sec:LHY_gas}

We now turn to the gas-phase double BEC and release the sample directly from the trap (without the additional magnetic field quenching) for $\widetilde{\delta g}$ from +0.344 to $-0.094$. To characterize the LHY effect, we measure the release energy $E_{\rm rel}=E_{\rm kin}+E_{\rm int}$ from the TOF expansion~\cite{Holland1997,Mewes1996,SM}. Here $E_\text{\rm kin}$ is the quantum pressure and $E_{\rm int}=E_{\rm MF}+E_{\rm LHY}$ is the total interaction energy. When $E_{\rm MF}$ is tuned to zero, $E_{\rm LHY}$ becomes the only interaction term in $E_{\rm rel}$. For negative $E_{\rm MF}$, the fact that the sample expands rather than collapses is also a direct manifestation of the LHY effect.

\subsection{Expansion of gas phase sample and Release energy}
%introduce the LHY gas, explain the difference between liquid droplet and LHY gas
In the previous sections, we describe a liquid phase droplet sample made of $^{23}\rm Na$--$^{87}\rm Rb$ BEC mixture. 
Now we turn to study the gas phase (LHY gas) of this mixture, in which the Lee-Huang-Yang effects still play an important role.
The mainly difference between a droplet and a LHY gas sample is whether the kinetic energy dominates the Hamiltonian.
For droplet sample, the competition mainly comes from the attractive mean-field term and the repulsive LHY term.
When the atomic number drops down, and both mean-field and LHY energy goes down, finally the kinetic energy gets not negligible.
After the balance point of density disappeared, as we describe about the liquid-gas phase transition, the sample turns to a gas-phase sample.

% talk about typical BEC and compare it with LHY gas
As we mentioned before, a typical BEC sample actually is in a gaseous phase, which means it tends to fill its container.
A 


by directly releasing the sample from the trap for $\widetilde{\delta g}$ from +0.322 to -0.146.
To characterize the LHY effect in this situation, we measure the release energy $E_{\rm rel}=E_{\rm kin}+E_{\rm int}$ from the TOF expansion~\cite{Holland1997,Mewes1996}. Here $E_\text{\rm kin}$ is the quantum pressure and $E_{\rm int}=E_{\rm MF}+E_{\rm LHY}$ is the total interaction energy. When $E_{\rm MF}$ is tuned to zero, $E_{\rm LHY}$ becomes the only interaction term in $E_{\rm rel}$. For negative $E_{\rm MF}$, the expansion of the sample, instead of collapsing, is also a direct manifestation of the LHY effect. 

We prepared the trapped double BEC and measured $E_{\rm rel}$ for both species from their TOF expansion velocities~\cite{SM,Holland1997} for several different $\widetilde{\delta g}$. The resulting total $E_{\rm rel}$ is shown as open squares in Fig.~\ref{fig4}. In general, $E_{\rm rel}$ depends on $\widetilde{\delta g}$, $N_1$ and $N_2$, and the density overlap between the two species. However, within the range of $\widetilde{\delta g}$, the densities of the double BEC are still rather high even in the gas phase, and significant three-body losses are still observed during the TOF. Thus, it is difficult to maintain constant $N_1$ and $N_2$ during the TOF for different $\widetilde{\delta g}$, even though great efforts have been taken to keep the initial atom numbers in the trap fixed. However, since $E_{\rm rel}$ is a measure of the energy per atom, it is not affected severely by the loss.

\caption[Measurement of the release energy as a function of $\widetilde{\delta g}$]{Measurement of the release energy as a function of $\widetilde{\delta g}$. The open squares represent $E_{\rm rel}$ of the gas phase mixtures released from the trap directly, while the solid circles are $E_{\rm rel}$ of the gas samples formed following the liquid-gas phase transition. The red solid (blue solid) curve is the calculated $E_{\rm rel}$ with (without) the LHY terms for the first case with GPEs and the red dashed curve is $E_{\rm rel}$ for the second case from variational theory.}  
\label{LHY-release}
\end{figure}


We calculated the $E_{\rm rel}$ with the eGPEs for the corresponding atom numbers at the end of the TOF and found a good match for both the $E_{\rm MF}\gg E_{\rm LHY}$ and the $E_{\rm MF} \approx 0$ regions (red solid curve in Fig.~\ref{fig4}). We note that without the LHY term, the calculation fails for $\widetilde{\delta g} < 0$ due to the collapse (blue solid curve in Fig.~\ref{fig4}). 
%In our system, near $\widetilde{\delta g} = 0$, $E_{\rm kin}$ is actually larger than $E_{\rm LHY}$. 
At the $\widetilde{\delta g} \approx 0$ point with $E_{\rm MF}$ almost canceled, the energy difference between the two calculations is about $1$~nK. This is essentially the magnitude of $E_\text{\rm LHY}$, if we assume $E_{\rm kin}$ does not change dramatically in these two cases.   

The gas phase mixture formed following the liquid-to-gas phase transition is also of great interest. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig2}(a), its expansion velocity can be measured and converted into another $E_{\rm rel}$ even though there is no trap involved. 
These results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig4} as solid circles for $\widetilde{\delta g}$ from -0.146 to -0.247. 
Compared with the gas phase mixture released from the trap, the $E_{\rm rel}$ here has a completely opposite dependence on $\widetilde{\delta g}$. 

This behavior can be qualitatively understood from the change of the total energy of the droplet ($E_\text{tot}$) during the phase transition. For large enough atom numbers, $E_{\rm tot}$ has a negative minimum, and the system is in the droplet phase. 
Following the number loss, $E_{\rm tot}$ increases gradually. The droplet becomes meta-stable when $E_{\rm tot}$ is above zero, and the system eventually enters the gas phase when the energy minimum disappears. The measured $E_{\rm rel}$ here reflects $E_\text{tot}$ at the phase transition point which also includes contributions from $E_{\rm LHY}$, $E_{\rm MF}$, and $E_{\rm kin}$.
%
For more negative $\widetilde{\delta g}$, the critical atom numbers at the phase transition point are smaller, but the sample size $\propto |\widetilde{\delta g}|^{-3/2}$ shrinks much steeper. As result, the increase of the positive $E_{\rm LHY}$ and $E_{\rm kin}$ terms are faster than the decrease of the negative $E_{\rm MF}$ term. $E_{\rm tot}$ is thus positive and the measured $E_{\rm rel}$ also follows the same trend and increases for more negative $\widetilde{\delta g}$. We note that without $E_{\rm LHY}$, the magnitude of $E_{\rm MF}$ is larger than $E_{\rm kin}$ and the system will collapse. This picture is confirmed by the variational calculation as depicted by the red dashed curve in Fig.~\ref{fig4}. A more detailed discussion can be found in supplementary material~\cite{SM}.

\section{Mode matching when producing droplet sample}
\label{sec:mode_match}

\subsection{In-trap vs. free-space sample}

During the release of the double BEC sample from the optical trap, the trap energy suddenly is removed suddenly but the size of the sample has no time to adapt to the new value. As shown in Fig.~\ref{figS1}, in general the in-trap size is smaller than the size of the ground-state free-space droplet at the energy minimum. The sample size will thus start to expand after released from the trap and its total energy (per particle) $E_{\rm tot} = E_{\rm kin} + E_{\rm int}$ will also start to evolve following the red curves. For the cases with very small $|\widetilde{\delta g}|$ [Fig.~\ref{figS1}(a)], $E_{\rm tot}$ is higher than the energy barrier at the right hand side. In this case, the sample will just keep expanding after crossing the maximum point and never forms the droplet.
While in Fig. \ref{figS1}(b), with $|\widetilde{\delta g}|$ large enough, 
the negative $E_{\rm tot}$ of the released sample is not enough to overcome the energy barrier and the droplet can be formed, but its size will undergo a small-amplitude oscillation.

\caption[Producing long-lived droplet by magnetic field quench]{Producing long-lived droplet by magnetic field quench. (a) For some weakly bound droplet, it is possible to find a $\widetilde{\delta g}$ 
value where the in-trap gas-phase sample size (blue dashed curve) is the same as the size of the free-space droplet (red solid curve). Quenching $\widetilde{\delta g}$ at the instant of releasing the sample, as depicted by the black dashed arrow, will lead to a near perfect mode matching. (b) and (c) show the experimentally measured droplet signals for $\widetilde{\delta g} = -0.141$ (349.880 G) and $\widetilde{\delta g} = -0.110$ (349.910 G) created with this method. At these magnetic fields, no 
droplet can be observed without the quench as they fall in the situation as described in Fig.~\ref{figS1}(a).}
\label{figS2}
\end{figure}


As described in the main text, to improve the mode matching, we used a nearly spherical shape trap for matching the sphere shape of the quantum droplet.
In addition, as the in-trap size of the double BEC also depends strongly on $\widetilde{\delta g}$, the magnetic field is controlled in a carefully designed sequence. After the double BEC is created, the magnetic field is first ramped up quickly across the Feshbach resonance to $358.4$~G where $a_{12}$ has a small positive value of $46.1a_0$.
After 350 ms for the system to stabilize, the magnetic field is ramped down to 350.451 G in 130 ms.
This is just 0.424 G above $B_c$ and the corresponding $a_{12}$ is $-39.5a_0$ ($\widetilde{\delta g} = +0.322$).
Here the double BEC is miscible and the attractive interaction increases the spatial overlap of the two condensates and also increases the in-trap 
densities substantially. Both effects significantly improve the mode matching and facilitate the free-space droplet formation.
At this point, rapid atom losses are already observed; thus, the magnetic 
field holds here for only 10 ms.
Afterwards, the magnetic field is ramped to a target value within 5 ms before the droplet is detected in free space.
As depicted in Fig.~\ref{figS1}(b), although droplet can be observed after these improvements for $|\widetilde{\delta g}|$ large enough, the mode matching is not perfect. For $\widetilde{\delta g}$ from 0 to -0.146, with the current atom numbers, the droplet cannot be observed by simply releasing the double BEC from the trap. As shown in Fig.~\ref{figS2}(a), even 
better mode matching can be achieved by finding a $\widetilde{\delta g}$ value where the in-trap size matches with the target droplet size and quenches $\widetilde{\delta g}$ at the same time when the trap is shut off. To achieve the fast magnetic field quenching necessary for this method, we added a small magnetic coil which is capable of covering the magnetic field range in less than 10 $\mu$s. Fig.~\ref{figS2}(b) and (c) show two droplets formed with this method. For case (b) with $\widetilde{\delta g} = -0.141$, the droplet lifetime i
s longer than the available observation time. For case (c) with $\widetilde{\delta g} = -0.110$, the liquid-to-gas phase transition is observed after about 7 ms. This short lifetime is probably limited by the atom numbers since at this $\widetilde{\delta g}$, the critical atom numbers are much larger.
